Epsilon-JDBC Integration
===========

Eclipse plugins that extend Epsilon's Model Connectivity (EMC) layer with support for managing data in relational (MySQL) databases using languages of the [Epsilon platform](http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon) to perform activities such as code generation, model validation and model-to-model transformation. The JDBC EMC driver is discussed in detail [in this article](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1089/6.pdf).
